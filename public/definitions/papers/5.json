    "abstract": "In light of the rapid development of countries around the globe, the ever-growing demand for knowledge and innovation has sparked a surge in the research of natural sciences and human sciences. While both branches of sciences possess the common spirit of generalising complex phenomena to an objective piece of knowledge, one may regard natural sciences more highly due to its comparatively more tangible and direct contribution to an individualâ€™s quality of life, such as technology. However, human sciences also ensure the stability of societies by providing indicators for policy-making, which are crucial to humanity. While there is an apparent tendency for empiricists and reliabilists to regard natural sciences more highly, this essay aims to discuss why this claim may not be solidly justified by uncovering the flaws of employing such a rationale.",
