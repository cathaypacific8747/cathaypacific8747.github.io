    "abstract": "Since the industrialisation of Hong Kong, the territory has observed a shortage in parking supply, resulting from the steady increase in car ownership and the declining growth rate in the number of parking spaces. This investigation focuses on providing a more solid understanding of the relationship between the spatial distribution of parking spaces and the local traffic in urban areas of Hong Kong, through on-site surveys and the Ga2SFCA method, so to build a more resilient and sustainable transport system.",
