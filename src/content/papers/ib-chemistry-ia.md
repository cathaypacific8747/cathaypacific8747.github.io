# Abstract
Under the influence of consumerism, the number of heavy-duty industries have risen exponentially over time. According to Ouyang et al., untreated wastewater includes large amounts of harmful heavy metals, which can severely disrupt the aquatic ecological system and groundwater table. This paper therefore attempts to investigate on the different parameters that can maximise the efficiency of copper ion removal from wastewater via adsorption.
