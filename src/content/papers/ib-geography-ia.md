# Abstract
With land in Hong Kong generally sold to the highest bidder, the land value is often argued to increase closer to the PLVI. By using building heights along four transects as a proxy indicator for the land value, this paper attempts to explore to what extent does Hong Kong fit this pattern, and verify whether land use models (Burgess Model, Hoyt Model, Functional Zone Model) apply.
